# TypeScript

Is TypeScript a Frontend or Backend Language?
Frontend: TypeScript is widely used in frontend frameworks and libraries like:
Angular (officially built with TypeScript)
React (with TypeScript support)
Vue (optional TypeScript integration)
Backend: TypeScript can also be used in backend development, especially with Node.js. Popular backend frameworks using TypeScript include:
NestJS (a TypeScript-first Node.js framework)
Express.js (with TypeScript support)
How TypeScript Works in the Frontend
Developers write TypeScript code with strong typing.
TypeScript is compiled (transpiled) to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).
The resulting JavaScript code runs in the browser just like regular JavaScript.
