# A Algorithm (A-star):*
f(n)=g(n)+h(n)

## Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
a heuristic function **ℎ(𝑛) h(n)** that estimates the cost from the current node 𝑛 n to the goal
It is not guaranteed to find the shortest path, as it does not consider the cost already incurred to reach a node. It can easily get trapped in local minima.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm （Like BFS without weight）
always expanding the node with the lowest cumulative cost (often called cost-so-far or **g(n)**) from the start.
Dijkstra’s algorithm does not use a heuristic function, and it guarantees the shortest path because it always chooses the path with the lowest actual cumulative cost.
Since Dijkstra’s algorithm explores all possible paths, it can be slower than algorithms that incorporate heuristics, especially for large graphs.

## A Algorithm (A-star):
Approach: A* is a combination of Dijkstra’s algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. It uses both the actual cost to reach the current node 
𝑔(𝑛)g(n) and the heuristic estimate ℎ(𝑛)h(n) of the cost to the goal. 
**f(n)=g(n)+h(n)**


## Relationship Summary:
GBFS is purely heuristic-driven and can be fast but is not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
Dijkstra's Algorithm ignores the heuristic and always finds the shortest path but can be slow, especially in large graphs.

A* balances both strategies by using the actual cost from the start h(n), which makes it more efficient than Dijkstra’s algorithm while still guaranteeing the shortest path (under an admissible heuristic).

In essence, Dijkstra's algorithm is a special case of A* where the heuristic h(n)=0, and GBFS is like A* without considering the actual cost g(n).
