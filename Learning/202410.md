# A Algorithm (A-star):*
f(n)=g(n)+h(n)

## Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
a heuristic function **ℎ(𝑛) h(n)** that estimates the cost from the current node 𝑛 n to the goal
It is not guaranteed to find the shortest path, as it does not consider the cost already incurred to reach a node. It can easily get trapped in local minima.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm （Like BFS without weight）
always expanding the node with the lowest cumulative cost (often called cost-so-far or **g(n)**) from the start.
Dijkstra’s algorithm does not use a heuristic function, and it guarantees the shortest path because it always chooses the path with the lowest actual cumulative cost.
Since Dijkstra’s algorithm explores all possible paths, it can be slower than algorithms that incorporate heuristics, especially for large graphs.

## A Algorithm (A-star):
Approach: A* is a combination of Dijkstra’s algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. It uses both the actual cost to reach the current node 
𝑔(𝑛)g(n) and the heuristic estimate ℎ(𝑛)h(n) of the cost to the goal. 
**f(n)=g(n)+h(n)**


## Relationship Summary:
GBFS is purely heuristic-driven and can be fast but is not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
Dijkstra's Algorithm ignores the heuristic and always finds the shortest path but can be slow, especially in large graphs.

A* balances both strategies by using the actual cost from the start h(n), which makes it more efficient than Dijkstra’s algorithm while still guaranteeing the shortest path (under an admissible heuristic).

In essence, Dijkstra's algorithm is a special case of A* where the heuristic h(n)=0, and GBFS is like A* without considering the actual cost g(n).

Get请求和Post请求的区别
  1. 首先从字面意思上
   Get的意思是“得到，获取”，Post的意思是“推送”。所以可见如果是Get方式，即浏览器向服务器请求得到一些数据；如果是Post方式，就是浏览器主动向服务器推送数据。

  2. 传送数据的方式不同
   Get方式会直接将参数放在URL地址的后面，用户可以直接看的见，而且Get方式，由于浏览器的不同，允许传送最大数据量的大小也不同，一般都是2KB
   Post方式传送数据时，会将数据放在http报文的请求体中，用户是看不见的，而且理论上传送的数据量大小没有限制。
   所以相对来说，Post方式要比Get方式更安全一些。

  3. 后台接收数据的方式不同

      //Get方式
      contxt.Request.QueryString["txtname"];
      //Post方式
      context.Request.Form["txtname"];

# 什么是thread，process，他们的关系？

A thread and a process are both fundamental concepts in computer programming for handling concurrent tasks. They help improve the efficiency and execution speed of programs, but they differ in nature and how they are used.

1. Process
Definition: A process is an instance of a program running on a computer. Each process has its own memory space, data, code, and resources.
Characteristics:
Independence: A process is an independent unit, and the operating system allocates separate memory for each process. One process cannot directly access another process's memory unless they communicate through Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
Resource management: A process has its own file descriptors, stack, registers, and address space. The operating system manages resources for the process.
High overhead: Creating, destroying, or switching between processes is resource-intensive because it requires switching context (e.g., saving and restoring CPU registers, changing memory, etc.).
Example: A web browser, text editor, or any application running on your system is a process.

2. Thread
Definition: A thread is a unit of execution within a process, often referred to as a "lightweight process." A process can have multiple threads, and these threads share the process's resources.
Characteristics:
Shared memory: All threads in a process share the same memory space (like the heap and global variables), making communication between threads easier and faster compared to communication between processes.
Independent execution: Each thread has its own program counter (PC), registers, and stack, so it can run independently.
Lower overhead: Threads are less resource-intensive to create and switch between because they don’t need separate memory spaces.
Concurrent execution: Multiple threads can run concurrently within the same process. For example, in a browser process, one thread might handle user input while another loads a webpage.

3. Relationship between Process and Thread
Threads belong to processes: A process can contain multiple threads, and threads cannot exist independently of a process. Each process has at least one main thread (the one that starts the process).

Shared vs. isolated memory: Threads within the same process share memory and global variables, while processes are isolated from each other and have their own memory. This makes communication between threads faster, but it also introduces challenges like thread safety (e.g., race conditions when multiple threads try to access the same resource).

Concurrency model: Processes are suited for tasks that need strong isolation because each process has its own resources and memory. Threads are better for tasks that are part of the same overall job because they share resources.

4. Summary
Process: An independent instance of a running program, with separate memory and resources.
Thread: A lightweight unit of execution within a process that shares resources with other threads in the same process.
Relationship: A thread is dependent on a process, and the process acts as a container for threads. Threads are more lightweight and suited for concurrent execution, while processes are better for tasks that require strict separation and isolation.
In short, both processes and threads enable concurrency, but they differ in terms of how they share resources and the overhead involved in managing them.
